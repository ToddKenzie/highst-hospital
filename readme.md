### Notes from the documentation

High St. Hospital has the following model at its facility:

* Employee
	* calculatePay() abstract method with no specifications
	* appropriate getter methods and toString()
* Patient
	* default BLOOD_LEVEL of 20

The following Instance Data will need to be taken care of for each employee
